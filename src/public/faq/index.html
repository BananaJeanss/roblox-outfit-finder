      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What does this site do?</strong><br />
        Roblox Outfit Finder lets you search for any Roblox user's saved outfits
        by entering their username or user ID.
        <br>
        This only includes user-saved outfits. Default/catalog outfits are excluded from the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How do I search for a user?</strong><br />
        Enter the user's Roblox username, or use id:USERID (e.g. 2837719) to search by user ID,
        then click "Find outfits".
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <strong>Why do I see a "ratelimited" or error message?</strong><br />
        The Roblox API has strict rate limits. If you see a ratelimit message,
        wait about 15-20 seconds and try again.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <strong>Why are some outfits missing images?</strong><br />
        Sometimes Roblox is still generating the outfit thumbnail, or the image
        is blocked. Try again later if you see "Loading..." or "Blocked".
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <strong>How long is data cached?</strong><br />
        User and outfit data is cached for 5 minutes to speed up repeat lookups
        and reduce API calls.
